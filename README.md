# Speech to Text Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented speech to text using Python. I used the libraries speech_recognition which helped me to build the project.

### Note:

Be sure that the audio file that you want to convert to text is in the current directory and that it contains english speech.

The audio file also needs to be a .wav file.
